# SSL Configuration Example
# Copy this to ssl-config.tfvars and update with your domain

# Enable SSL/HTTPS support
enable_ssl = true

# Your domain name (requires existing Route 53 hosted zone)
# Examples:
# - api.tetris.briancq.people.aws.dev (AWS employee subdomain)
# - api.tetris.yourdomain.com (custom domain)
domain_name = "api.tetris.example.com"

# Note: The hosted zone for the parent domain must already exist in Route 53
# For "api.tetris.example.com", you need a hosted zone for "tetris.example.com" or "example.com"
